# About This Course {-}

## What is this? {-}

This is a collaboratively written guide for Bio 106: General Biology II at queens college. 

### Annotations {-}

Notice that there's a little arrow to the side of the screen. Click the arrow and see what happens, or just highlight some text on this page, and you'll notice a little widget comes out that lets you highlight or annotate text. 

You'll need to sign up for [hypothesis.is](https://web.hypothes.is) to do this when you're in the side pane. It's an open source tool meant to get people to annotate and peer review the internet, including R Markdown books, and you can use it to suggest small changes to this book or discuss its content/ask questions. This video explains it a bit more.
